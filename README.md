# Pin_Validator
This project is a simple yet effective HTML-based PIN validation tool designed to ensure user input strictly matches a 4-digit numerical format. Built with basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, it provides real-time feedback to users by highlighting errors such as entering fewer or more than four digits or including non-numeric characters. The clean interface and user-friendly experience make it an ideal demonstration of JavaScript form validation techniques. This project serves as a hands-on example for beginners looking to understand input validation and DOM manipulation in client-side development.
